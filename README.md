# Working Hours Calculator App

The Working Hours Calculator App is a mobile application built using React Native and SQLite. The app allows users to track their working hours by recording clock-in and clock-out times for different projects or tasks. Users can easily calculate the total duration of their work sessions and keep a log of their activities.

## Features

1. **Clock-In and Clock-Out**: Users can clock in and clock out to start and end their work sessions. The app records the timestamp of each action.

2. **Work Log Management**: The app maintains a log of all work sessions, storing the clock-in and clock-out times for each session. The data is stored in an SQLite database, allowing users to view and analyze their work history.

3. **Duration Calculation**: The app calculates the duration of each work session by subtracting the clock-in time from the clock-out time. The total duration for each session is displayed to the user.

4. **Project/Task Tracking**: Users can assign different projects or tasks to their work sessions. This helps organize the logged data and allows users to review their activities based on specific projects or tasks.

5. **User Interface**: The app provides a user-friendly interface to view the clock-in and clock-out times, calculate durations, and navigate through the work log.

## Technical Components

- **React Native**: The app is developed using React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

- **SQLite**: The SQLite database engine is used to store and manage the work log data. The `react-native-sqlite-storage` package is utilized to interact with the SQLite database from the React Native app.

- **State Management**: React Native's `useState` hook is employed to manage the application's state, including the clocked-in status, clock-in time, clock-out time, and project/task information.

- **UI Components**: The app utilizes various React Native UI components, such as `SafeAreaView`, `View`, `Text`, and `TouchableOpacity`, to build the user interface and handle user interactions.

## Potential Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Implementing user authentication can allow multiple users to have separate work logs and securely access their own data.

- **Data Visualization**: Enhancing the app with charts and graphs can provide users with visual representations of their work hours, enabling them to identify patterns and trends.

- **Exporting and Reporting**: Adding functionality to export work logs as CSV or PDF files or generating reports can facilitate sharing or archiving the recorded data.

- **Notifications**: Incorporating reminders or notifications can prompt users to clock in or out at specific times or when certain conditions are met.

By following the steps provided earlier and customizing the code as needed, you can create your own Working Hours Calculator App using React Native and SQLite.
